This repository contains the code for a front-end lyric locator app. The app is built using React + Vite and styled using Bootstrap. It is responsive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices. It uses the <a href="https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#" target="_blank">lyrics.ovh</a> API to fetch song lyrics. The lyrics can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.

To run the project, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or, you can view the live demo <a href="https://lyric-locator.onrender.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
